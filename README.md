this is a course project on designing storm water drainage system that I did during the course CE 462 in iitk. there is a pdf named prepration of intensity with all the findings of this project
# Abstract
Stormwater management is crucial for urban infrastructure design to mitigate
flooding risks. This report presents a comprehensive methodology for preparing
Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves, essential for understanding rainfall
characteristics and designing effective stormwater drainage systems. The study
includes data preparation, statistical analysis, design calculations, and hydraulic
considerations. Results showcase the relationship between rainfall intensity, duration,
and return period, facilitating robust infrastructure design.

# 1. Introduction
Stormwater management is essential in urban infrastructure design to mitigate
flooding risks and ensure public safety. Preparation of Intensity-Duration-Frequency
(IDF) curves is critical for understanding rainfall characteristics and designing
effective stormwater drainage systems.
# 2. Methodology
Data Preparation: Raw rainfall data was imported and analyzed to visualize intensity
distribution.
Outlier Detection: Box plots were employed to identify and remove outliers for data
accuracy.
Statistical Analysis: Fitting rainfall data to Gumbel and log-normal distributions
aided in selecting the best-fit distribution.
Intensity Calculation: log normal and Gumbel functions were developed to
calculate rainfall intensity at various return periods.
# 3. Results
Distribution Fitting: Summary statistics of Gumbel and log-normal distributions
demonstrated their suitability for different time intervals.
Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) Curves: Graphical representations depicted the
relationship between rainfall intensity, duration, and return period.
# 4. Design Calculations for Stormwater Infrastructure
Constant Calculations: Constants were computed for concentration time and peak
flow discharge calculations.
Peak Flow Discharge Estimation: Computation of peak flow discharge and time of
concentration for each manhole.
Pipe Sizing: Calculations for pipe diameters to ensure adequate conveyance
capacity.
Elevation Estimations and Hydraulic Design: Calculations of upstream and
downstream crown and inverted elevations for proper alignment.
# 5. Storm Intensity Calculation
Utilization of developed intensity calculation function to determine storm intensity.
# 6. Hyetograph Calculation
Calculation of hyetograph using the alternative block method for given time
intervals.
# 7. Conclusion
Preparation of IDF curves and subsequent design calculations are crucial for
developing resilient stormwater drainage infrastructure. Understanding rainfall
patterns and estimating peak flows enable effective management of stormwater
runoff, reducing flood risk, and enhancing urban resilience to extreme weather
events.
