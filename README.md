# SWDS
this is a course project on designing storm water drainage system that I did during the course CE 462 in iitk. there is a pdf named prepration of intensity with all the findings of this project
# Abstract
Stormwater management is crucial for urban infrastructure design to mitigate
flooding risks. This report presents a comprehensive methodology for preparing
Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves, essential for understanding rainfall
characteristics and designing effective stormwater drainage systems. The study
includes data preparation, statistical analysis, design calculations, and hydraulic
considerations. Results showcase the relationship between rainfall intensity, duration,
and return period, facilitating robust infrastructure design.
